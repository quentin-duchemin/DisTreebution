# DisTreebution

**DisTreebution** fits **distributional regression trees and forests** to generate **calibrated probabilistic forecasts**.

It optimizes trees using:  
- **Pinball loss** for quantile regression  
- **CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score)** for full distributional calibration  

This allows the model to produce predictions that accurately capture **uncertainty** and **risk**.
